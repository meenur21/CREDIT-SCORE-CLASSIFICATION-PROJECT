# CREDIT-SCORE-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT


Credit Score Classification Model Development

Background:
Welcome to the Credit Score Classification Model Development project at ICTAK. This initiative is designed to create a predictive model that categorizes customers into three levels of creditworthiness: Good, Standard, and Poor. The model will serve as a crucial tool for banks and financial institutions for loan approvals and risk assessments.

Project Description:
As a data scientist in a global finance corporation, this project entails developing a system using data science and machine learning to automate the categorization of individuals based on their credit scores. This system aims to reduce manual credit assessment efforts and enable more tailored financial services by accurately classifying customers.

Data Description:
Our dataset includes various features such as:-

ID and Customer_ID: Unique identifiers.
Month: Time period of data record.
Age, Occupation, Annual_Income, Num_Bank_Accounts, etc.: Customer demographics and financial details.
Credit_Score: Target variable for classification.
